# Mocks
Mocks are used mainly for unit tests. Basically, we create objects/data for specific tests, then avoid replicating the code. For example, if we have a process that has three steps, we can create a mocked data for each process, so we don't need to wait for the first step to test the second one, because we already have the mocked data for it.
